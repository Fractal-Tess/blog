# Blog

A simple personal blog built with Astro where I write about security, CTF writeups, and occasionally other tech topics.

## Features

- **Multiple themes**: Choose from various editor-inspired themes that affect both the site appearance and code syntax highlighting
- **Markdown posts**: Write posts in Markdown with support for math equations, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and custom directives
- **Character dialogues**: Use custom character directives (duck, unicorn, owl) to add conversational elements to posts
- **Tags & series**: Organize posts with tags and group related posts into series
- **RSS feed**: Subscribe to posts via RSS
- **Search**: Full-text search across all posts
- **Reading time**: Automatic reading time estimates for posts
- **Social cards**: Auto-generated preview images for social media sharing
- **Table of contents**: Automatic TOC generation for longer posts

Nothing fancy, just a place to dump thoughts and document things I've learned.

## Credits

This blog is based on the [MultiTerm Astro](https://github.com/stelcodes/multiterm-astro) theme by [stelcodes](https://github.com/stelcodes), which provides a solid foundation with multiple theme support and markdown extensions.
